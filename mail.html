        Now that we have gathered enough preliminary data, we hope you are ready
        to begin learning Python with us! Our goal is to launch phase 2 of Aiki
        on May 10th. But before you can do that, we need you to do a little more
        science for us.
      </p>

      <p style="margin: 1.5em 1em">
        As part of the study, we need to know how much Aiki improves your Python
        skills (if any). That means we need you to fill out a Python quiz before
        and after you use Aiki, so we can have data on if Aiki worked for you.
      </p>

      <p style="margin: 1.5em 1em">
        To be completely clear, it is <em>absolutely OK</em> to completely fail
        at this test. In fact, it’s very important that you do not google for
        answers during the test. For the best science, we ask that you answer to
        the best of your ability <em>using only your current knowledge</em>.
        With this in mind, “I don’t know” is a perfectly valid answer to every
        question. <u>We are not grading you</u>, this is just setting a start
        point so we can see how much you’ve improved in 2 months.
      </p>

      <p style="margin: 1.5em 1em">
        The test should take about 30 minutes, so set aside some time, get some
        coffee, and take the test at

      <p style="margin: 1.5em 1em">
        You’ll hear from us again on May 10th with the new version of Aiki!
